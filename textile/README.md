TEXTILE (Tutorials for EXperimenTalist Interactive LEarning) in Data Science
=======

![Logo](/images/logo.png)

This TEXTILE curriculum teaches trainees data science from the biological
perspective of brain cell shape quantification.

What is TEXTILE?
===========

In the Disease Directed Engineering Lab (nancelab.com), we develop tools to
inform how we can more effectively treat the diseased brain. In our lab, we take
a lot of cool immunofluorescent images of brain cells. To better analyze those
cells, we developed a data science pipeline for cell segmentation and
quantification. To train others within and outside of our lab to use our cell
quantification pipeline, we developed TEXTILE!

This is the home repository for our first TEXTILE course from Summer 2020.

TEXTILE Curriculum
===========

TEXTILE is a semi-linear, module-based learning system!

What does that mean?

/_semi-linear_/ We have three linear pathways to follow along with:

1. **Research Lab Specific** (purple, top row): Motivates the greater TEXTILE
work within the context of the Disease Directed Engineering Lab.
2. **Data Science Specific** (green, middle row): The data science fundamentals
needed to support the end learning goal of image processing and train students
on data management for experimentalists.
3. **Image Processing Specific** (blue, bottom row): The cell segmentation and
quantification lessons

Based on the personal preference and previous experience of the trainee, the
three pathways can be followed independently or together. Additionally, based on
students' previous experience, the curriculum can begin at any point on the
linear pathway. For example, if the student is familiar with data science but
not image processing, they can learn only the image processing specific pathway
and skip the data science specific pathway.

/_module-based_/ Every lesson is a module with three parts:
1. **pre-module**: A primer to get you thinking about the main lesson
2. **main module**: The main educational lesson
3. **post-module**: A reflection exercise with opportunities to explore more
independently.

How to Use as a Student:
===========

Welcome to TEXTILE! We hope this curriculum can jump start your cell analysis
work.

1. Determine starting point: (below are some examples)

    - No coding experience: Start at beginning of Data Science Pathway

    - Coding experience without image processing experience: Skip the data Science
pathway and begin with the Image Processing Specific Pathway

    - Trainee with the Disease Directed Engineering Lab: Begin with the
Data Science in the Nance Lab module. Then begin the data science specific
pathway, followed by the image processing specific pathway before doing the
Research Paper Specific Workflow module back in the Research Lab Specific
Pathway.

2. Download the repository

3. Work through the modules in linear order based on the pathways you chose

How to Use as an Instructor
===========
Welcome to TEXTILE! For instructors we have two pathways to follow: Teaching
Current Modules and Developing Your Own Curriculum.

Teaching Current Modules:
---
1. Download the repository and plan to teach the Data Science Specific and
Image Processing Specific pathways
2. At least two days before the lesson, send out the pre-module activity
3. Teach the module live either by presenting the PPT file in earlier Modules
 or completing a code-along with areas for students to ask questions and explore
 independently
4. After the lesson, send out the post-module reflection to students

Developing Your Own Curriculum:
---
1. Identify your end goal: We recommend a methodology that produces a data set
with a large number of features and application variability
2. Break down your end goal into the basic units needed to learn it (each of
  these units becomes a module)
3. Organize the modules by topics (these become the linear pathways)
4. Follow the "How to Module" Module PPT to explore how to design learning
objectives and create modules of your own

What's next for TEXTILE?
===========
Thanks for asking! We are planning an expansion for Summer 2022 which will
include:
1. Recorded lessons of the current curriculum
2. Machine learning lessons for multiple particle tracking
3. Demos of wet lab techniques used to acquire data in curriculum
4. Lessons on database management for nanotherapeutic experiments
5. Additional instructor material such as a syllabus and suggested classroom
timelines

We look forward to sharing the next evolution of our curriculum.
