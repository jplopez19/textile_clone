Typo/Inconsistency Findings: 
"exists the building" should be "exits the building" (from pre-module activity question two). 
Under the main module and pre-module section, the link to understanding data types is just inserted into the paragraph without context or instruction to click. It would be helpful to explicitly direct the students to click on the link for more information on data types. 
Module Follow-up Feedback: Overall, the module was informative, with engaging activities. The scenario of tracking coffee consumption made it relevant and relatable, serving as an interesting way to introduce experimental data management. The module also tied into real-life laboratory experiments, making the content even more applicable. However, some instructions were quite lengthy, making it a bit hard to digest and follow at times. 
Improved Summaries: 
Pre-Module Activity: Gain an understanding of data management through a practical, everyday scenario in a research lab - the case of the disappearing coffee. Learn how to identify key variables, choose suitable data recording methods, plan data sharing and security, and think about long-term reproducibility of your methods. 
Learning Outcomes: 
Understand the basic principles and importance of data management 
Learn how to identify and categorize relevant data in a given context 
Practice choosing an appropriate data recording and storing method 
Consider data sharing, security, and long-term reproducibility 
Main Module: Dig deeper into experimental data management by applying the principles learned in the pre-module activity to a disease-focused experimental setup. Practice identifying variables, planning for data tracking and security, and thinking about experimental reproducibility in a scientific research context. 
Learning Outcomes: 
Apply data management principles to a scientific research context 
Further practice in identifying and categorizing relevant data in a complex context 
Enhance understanding of data tracking, sharing, and security in research 
Develop skills in planning for experimental reproducibility 
Post-Module Activity: Consider the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in research. Identify an ideal research team for your experiment and estimate the training time required for your experimental methods. Reflect on the module and raise any questions or points of confusion. 
Learning Outcomes: 
Understand the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in scientific research 
Practice identifying necessary skills and backgrounds for an ideal research team 
Gain insight into the time investment required for learning experimental methods 
Reflect on learned content and clarify points of confusio
