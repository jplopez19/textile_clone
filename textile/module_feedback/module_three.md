Typo/Inconsistency Findings: 
"exists the building" should be "exits the building" (from pre-module activity question two). 
Under the main module and pre-module section, the link to understanding data types is just inserted into the paragraph without context or instruction to click. It would be helpful to explicitly direct the students to click on the link for more information on data types. 
Module Follow-up Feedback: Overall, the module was informative, with engaging activities. The scenario of tracking coffee consumption made it relevant and relatable, serving as an interesting way to introduce experimental data management. The module also tied into real-life laboratory experiments, making the content even more applicable. However, some instructions were quite lengthy, making it a bit hard to digest and follow at times. 
Improved Summaries: 
Pre-Module Activity: Gain an understanding of data management through a practical, everyday scenario in a research lab - the case of the disappearing coffee.

I want you to act as a student completing module 3 from the TEXTILE program. I want you provide feedback on the module to help improve the overall quality of the educational module. 
Feedback Instructions:  
Check the modules and forms for typos/inconsistencies. List those out for us to improve upon! 
Provide feedback for us on how well you were able to follow the module 
After completing the module, write out improved summaries of the modules based on your experience as a student. Please include learning objections/outcomes. 
What is TEXTILE? 
In the Disease Directed Engineering Lab (nancelab.com), we develop tools to inform how we can more effectively treat the diseased brain. In our lab, we take a lot of cool immunofluorescent images of brain cells. To better analyze those cells, we developed a data science pipeline for cell segmentation and quantification. To train others within and outside of our lab to use our cell quantification pipeline, we developed TEXTILE! 
This is the home repository for our first TEXTILE course from Summer 2020. 
TEXTILE Curriculum 
TEXTILE is a semi-linear, module-based learning system! 
What does that mean? 
/semi-linear/ We have three linear pathways to follow along with: 
Research Lab Specific (purple, top row): Motivates the greater TEXTILE work within the context of the Disease Directed Engineering Lab. 
Data Science Specific (green, middle row): The data science fundamentals needed to support the end learning goal of image processing and train students on data management for experimentalists. 
Image Processing Specific (blue, bottom row): The cell segmentation and quantification lessons 
Based on the personal preference and previous experience of the trainee, the three pathways can be followed independently or together. Additionally, based on students' previous experience, the curriculum can begin at any point on the linear pathway. For example, if the student is familiar with data science but not image processing, they can learn only the image processing specific pathway and skip the data science specific pathway. 
/module-based/ Every lesson is a module with three parts: 
pre-module: A primer to get you thinking about the main lesson 
main module: The main educational lesson 
post-module: A reflection exercise with opportunities to explore more independently. 
 
Textile Data Science Module 3: An Introduction to Experimental Data Management 
Data Priming: The purpose of this priming activity is to introduce TEXTILE trainees to the concept and importance of Data Management. 
Please watch this video (and then answer the following questions): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYDb-GP1CA4

Pre-Module Activity: Preliminary Data Management Planning for Your Own Experiment 
It is one of your duties to make coffee every morning for the lab. You don't mind the task. And you usually get to go back for a few more cups throughout the day. But recently not only have __you__ not been able to get any coffee, but your lab mates have been complaining to you that the coffee machine is __always__ empty.  
 
So you have just decided to start a new research experiment on the behavior of your lab mates.  
 
Your hypothesis is that one of your lab mates has been pouring the coffee down the sink every morning because of a few signs of evidence: 
(1) The coffee cup stack has not been decreasing 
(2) The faint smell of coffee has been lingering on the bathroom sink 
(3) You are tired because of your lack of afternoon caffeine 
Identify the variables that you want to study to figure out if your hypothesis is correct (including any unknown information). Also identify what type of data it is 
How are you are going to keep track of this information. i.e. excel, notebook, pen and paper? 
 
Your desk is around the corner from the breakroom so you can see whoever enters and exists the building, but cannot naturally watch the machine 24/7 since you still have a job to do. 
Are you going to share this data with anyone? If yes, then how? How do you ensure that data is secure? 
Identify any final graphs/figures you would need to support your hypothesis 
If this problem occurs again in another year, will someone be able to take your data and figure out who the culprit is? 
Will someone else be able to follow your methods to search for a new culprit? 
Go back through the above steps and account for things you may have missed during the first pass including but not limited to (your lab mates work schedules, alternative hypothesis, and the security of your data) Include at least three things outside of this list that you didn't think of before 
After the above activity, do you feel prepared to run and manage an experiment about the coffee culprit? 
New question: What equipment, supplies, and materials do you need to run your experiment? How do you think research labs and researchers find funding? 
After the above activity, do you feel prepared to run and manage an experiment? Why or why not? 
Main Module: Experimental Plan 
Learning to do good data management and design well thought out experimental plans takes practice! In a couple of weeks we will be going through a high throughput cell analysis pipeline that requires these skills so I want you all to start thinking about it now.  
Go to Paper 2 in #research_and_papers - Disease-directed engineering for physiology-driven treatment interventions in neurological disorders 
For question 3, I asked you to design your "perfect experiment for a disease of your choice. What models, controls, resources would you need? What do you think will be the biggest difficulties to account for?"  Repeat the questions from the Pre-Module for your disease and experiment of choice. (If you already responded to the discussion question no need to respond again, I can see both answers) 
I know you all still have a lot to learn about biology and disease pathology, but thinking about these plans are good experiments for writing undergraduate research proposals, grad school applications, and thinking about research on a different level. Don't feel stress - it is highly unlikely any of you will design the perfect experiment (because its highly unlikely any of us or even Dr. Nance could do that not because you aren't all capable!) 
What is your disease of choice and hypothesis? 
Identify the variables that you want to study to figure out if your hypothesis is correct (including any unknown information). Also identify what type of data it is (https://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/understanding-qualitative-quantitative-attribute-discrete-and-continuous-data-types) 
How are you are going to keep track of this information. i.e. excel, notebook, pen and paper? 
Are you going to share this data with anyone? If yes, then how? How do you ensure that data is secure? 
Identify any final graphs/figures you would need to support your hypothesis 
If this problem occurs again in another year, will someone be able to reproduce your experiment in the future? How could you make reproducibility better? 
Post-Module Activity: A lot of research is done in collaboration with other researchers. Experimental data often comes from a lot of sources and many backgrounds! 
Imagine an ideal team of 5 people for your research project: What degrees do they have? (Use this question as an opportunity to explore different disciplines such as neuroscience, computer science, chemical engineering, and bioengineering. I recommend looking up papers on research using Google Scholar or pubmed on your disease of choice and seeing the affiliations of the authors) 
To do experimental methodology, you often need to be trained on different methods. Assuming it takes about a month to be trained on any one method, how long do you estimate your training to complete this experiment will be? 
Do you have any questions regarding this module?
