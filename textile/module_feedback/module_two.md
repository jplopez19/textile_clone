**Feedback on Data Science Module 2: An Image as Numbers**

Typos/Inconsistencies: No typos or inconsistencies were identified in the module that were not corrected immediately 
Module Comprehension: 
The overall module was engaging, with good explanations of Python as a base language, python packages as tools, and practical demonstrations of data science applications in the coding language. 
The explanations of importing libraries like Numpy, Scikit-Image, and Matplotlib were clear and the purpose of each package was well defined. 
Good plug-ins for resources that might aid in coding such as stack overflow. I would recommend ChatGPT or other large langauge models as I find them extremely useful when coding.  
The step-by-step format of the module, starting from the necessary imports to viewing the image as a computer does, helped me understand the progression of tasks in an organized way. It was helpful creating a standard notebook format that highlights each step and what the code does.  
The explanation of what tif is and how it will be used was helpful. 
One major critique that I have was a lack of clarity about file paths and how to ensure the image file is in the same directory as the Python script. I originally encountered an error message because of my file being in the wrong path (which may have been only user error on my end but I find this to be a common problem in coding). A brief tutorial on how to set the correct path/directory could be useful to prevent future errors. 
Also further clarification on how tp handle error messages or potential problems might also be useful. For example how to read an error message.

Data Science Module 2: An Image as Numbers 
This module introduces the basics of image processing using Python. It begins by explaining the usage and significance of Python packages such as numpy, skimage, and matplotlib, which are necessary tools for handling, processing, and visualizing images. The module then demonstrates how to load an image, specifically a TIFF image, in Python and present it as an array of numbers, which is how the computer interprets the image. 
Learning Outcomes/Objectives: 
Understand the use of Python packages in image processing 
Understand the differences between various image formats, specifically TIFF and JPEG 
Learn how to load an image in Python using skimage 
Learn to understand an image as an array of numbers 
Learn how to manipulate and visualize different layers of an image (red, green, blue) 
Interactive Session Feedback: 
Pre-Module: Viewing an Image in Google Colab These questions serve as an effective primer and are designed to stimulate the student's thinking about the upcoming content. They help the students grasp the purpose of the packages they are using and foster curiosity about the difference in image perception between humans and computers. 
Main Module: An Image as Numbers The questions are very informative and help cement the understanding of the material. They draw attention to the crucial aspects of the module, such as image dimensions and their meanings. 
Post-Module Activity The activity is very engaging and allows students to experiment and learn by doing. It would have been beneficial to provide some hints or steps to guide the students in adapting the notebook. 
Module Reflection This part is crucial as it allows students to reflect on what they've learned and how their understanding has changed. It helps consolidate learning and identifies areas of confusion that may need further clarification. 
Questions about the module: 
Could you provide more information about the importance and application of viewing images in different color channels (red, green, blue)? 
Could you provide more information on how to set the correct path or directory for the file imports? 
Could there be additional guidance on how to adapt the notebook for different images in the post-module activity?
